    :w        : Save current modifications
    :q        : Exit current file (fails if changes haven't been saved)
    :q!       : Exit without saving changes
    :wq       : Save and exit current file (fails if changes could not be saved)
    :w!       : Force save (if file in read-only mode, ...)
    :wq!      : Force save then exit (equivalent to :w! then :q)
